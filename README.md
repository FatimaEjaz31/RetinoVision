RetinoVision: Generalizable Diabetic Retinopathy Detection through Anatomical and Pathological Feature Extraction*

This project focuses on detecting diabetic retinopathy by segmenting retinal vessels and identifying pathological lesions. It integrates image processing techniques and machine learning methods to analyze fundus images for early-stage diagnosis and improved generalizability.

Features

- Retinal blood vessel segmentation using deep learning
- Detection and classification of lesions (e.g., microaneurysms, hemorrhages)
- Modular code structure using Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset support via uploaded .zip lesions archive
Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
